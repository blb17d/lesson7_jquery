### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned about what Jquery is- an online database that allows coders to access Javascript tasks with a minimal amount of code.  It allows files to be smaller because developers are using less code.  
2. I further learned how to use Jquery. All statements must begins with a $. This is so that the code knows that the following sequence should reference the Jquery library. The $ must be followed by a request in parenthesis.
3. I learned about Jquery built-in-effects, what they are and how they work. A speed must be noted for all animations. They can be millisecond, slow, or fast.
